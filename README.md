# Demonstrature

This project is an application which is meant to help university laboratory exercises demonstrators in scheduling and working with each other.

It is built as a single page MVC C# .NET application on backend and Typescript/Knockout/SCSS on frontend side. I prefer to think of myself as a backend developer so it may not be the prettiest thing.

### P.S.
It is still **work in progress**, mainly because I want it to be perfect. Perfection takes time :)
This is also the reason why the work is still on **development branch**.

### P.P.S.
If someone does end up on this repository, some commits are in Croatian since it's my native language.
